## Mobile Optimization

**97% of users are mobile**[[1]](https://www.notion.so/MVP-Plan-ffb2629a0e624b9196a23d4a4eff2855?pvs=21) - mobile MUST be perfect

**Mobile-Specific Adjustments:**

1. **Hero:**
   - Stack vertically (headline → subheadline → button)
   - Make button full-width on mobile
   - Reduce headline size (48px → 32px)
2. **Problem Statement:**
   - Stack 3 columns vertically
   - Add more spacing between cards
3. **How It Works:**
   - Vertical flow (not horizontal)
   - Larger icons (easier to see)
4. **Features:**
   - One column only
   - Larger text (18px minimum)
5. **Pricing:**
   - Stack cards vertically
   - Highlight "Starter" with border/shadow
6. **Forms:**
   - Full-screen modal (not popup)
   - Large input fields (48px height minimum)
   - Large buttons (48px height minimum)
