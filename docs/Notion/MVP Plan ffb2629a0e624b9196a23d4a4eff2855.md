- **Onboarding Intervention**: Real-time help for stuck users, automated follow-up emails

### Post-Launch Sprint 1

- **Search**: Global search across tasks, decisions, documents, chat history
- **Referral System**: Invite friends, track referrals, auto-apply rewards

### Critical Questions to Answer

- **Payment failures**: Retry logic, grace period, downgrade timing
